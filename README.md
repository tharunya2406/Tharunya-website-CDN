“For this project, I first created an Amazon S3 bucket to store my static website files such as index.html, login.html and register.html and style.CSS files. This helped me understand how AWS S3 is used for storing website content.
Next, I created a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket so that my website can be accessed globally with low latency using a CDN.
To understand server-based hosting, I also launched an EC2 instance and installed the Apache web server (httpd). I used the EC2 public IP address to access the website through a browser. Even though the website is static, EC2 helped me learn how web servers, public IPs, and security groups work in AWS.
Overall, this project helped me understand different AWS hosting approaches and how cloud services like S3, CloudFront, and EC2 are used to deploy and access websites.”
